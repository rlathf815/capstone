A shader effect to drive blood when it hits a wall.

When this profab is spawned or intanciated on a wall it will begin to drip and then dry and then fade and then destory its parent group object.
This is designed to be spawned on nearby walls when something is cut or shot at or sliced or maimed, you name it.

The script controls the shader values and the shader drives the effect.

Texture driver in the shader:
Red channel: general tone variation for the color
Green Channel: the overall drip shape
Blue channel: the movement power (more blue more movement, more black less movement)

Normal map generated from the Shape (green channel with some small blur), used NormalMap online to generate the normal map.

Please adjust the sliders until you get the desired effect.

Adjust the script variables in the inspector for the speed and drying speed.

Please note 
Fade, Blood dry and some other effects are driven from the script so be sure to set them back to 0 in the materials if you have adjusted them
for checking.

Prefabs have been premade with ideal settings.

Please see the videos for more details.
